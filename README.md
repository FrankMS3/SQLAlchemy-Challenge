# SQLAlchemy-Challenge

To begin, open and run the script contained within the "climate_starter.ipynb" file. This will analyse the dataset files contained within the Resources folder, and output two figures.  
Next, open and run the Flask API contained within the "app.py" file. Check the terminal if you're unsure what address this API is running on. The homepage of this API will contain a list of the available routes, as well as what each route contains.
